This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Feedback

- How to handle the errors?
  - Feedback on the email?
- Use more standard spacing, avoid as most as possible random spacing.
- Tokens for the colors and common style we reuse
- Maybe align blocks on the center?
- Validate email, should we use a validator library?
- Missing link hover state style
- A base for all colors, font, spacing and base compoonent would be super nice.
- Translate system to put in place
- Better token naming
- Missing email/login in menu for mobile
- verify-email should be real svg
- Email color is different on sign in/sign up
- Link on the arcads icon ?
- Design of sign in/sign up seems to be inverted
